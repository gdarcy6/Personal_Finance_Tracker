# Personal Finance Tracker

This Personal Finance Dashboard is a finance tracking application built using Streamlit for the user interface and SQLite for creating an SQL database and utilises SQL functions to manipulate the users financial database.

The application has been designed to help the user effectively manage their income, expenses, savings, and debts in an intuitive and interactive way. 
The dashboard features multiple sections, including an Overview, where users can get a quick snapshot of their financials through key metrics like total income, total expenses, remaining balance, total savings, and outstanding debtâ€”all displayed alongside an interactive pie chart. 

The user can log income and expenses with categorized entries, track savings goals and monthly contributions, and manage debts by recording owed amounts, interest rates, and minimum payments. 
The app includes a debt repayment calculator, estimating the time required to pay off debts based on minimum payments and additional contributions. 
It also allows users to make extra payments, automatically updating the remaining balance and reflecting changes in financial standing, while accounting for interest rates. 

A built-in database reset option ensures users can start fresh when needed, clearing all stored data from the database.
